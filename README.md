To use this program first create your pages in `content` directory of the program.
Inside the directory you can have however file structure.
Put your custom assets in `static` directory. 

## Local use
Run `main.sh` script. It will create a local server on port 8888 with the static site on it

Inside `build.sh` file write GitHub repository name as an argument (in my case `"/static_site_generator/"`). It will create a `doc` folder inside the project. Then push the project to your repository.
